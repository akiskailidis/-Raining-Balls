# Raining Balls

A small Unity game where the player pilots a spaceship while avoiding falling planets. The game takes place on a grid-based environment, and the player must survive by navigating around obstacles. Collision with any planet results in a game over.

## Gameplay Overview

- You control a spaceship that moves freely across a 2D or 3D grid.
- Planets (or balls) fall from above, either randomly or on command.
- The goal is to avoid all falling objects.
- If your spaceship touches a planet, the game ends.

## Features

- Player-controlled spaceship movement
- Dynamic spawning of falling planets
- Collision detection and game over logic
- Grid-based visual environment
- Camera movement (pan, follow, rotate)

## Controls

- Arrow keys or WASD: Move the spaceship
- Mouse or Q/E: Rotate or pan the camera
- Spacebar or mouse click: Spawn a new falling planet
